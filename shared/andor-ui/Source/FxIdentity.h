/**
    V5 PATTERNED HARDWARE (docs/VISUAL_IDENTITY_INDEX.md): one visual identity per device -
    its muted enamel, its original motif, its inks and its graph glass - shared by the routing
    tile, the FX library, the quick settings and the full 214 px rack, so the miniature and the
    rack read as the same instrument at two scales.

    Interface only: derived from the effect's type (never saved, never a parameter), painted on
    the message thread from cached-free vector geometry with fixed seeds (the same picture in
    every session and screenshot).
